                    <p>The debate about the power of naming is long-running and contentious, engaging citizens and colonizers, academics and activists.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-81-1" href="http://www.mekongcommons.org/politics-of-place-naming-salween-river/#fn-81-1">1</a></sup> “South” of China, “East” of India, Southeast Asia were names that came primarily from people not native to these regions who imagined these areas as a region through acts of war and nation building.</p>
                    <p>These names and acts of naming also influenced subsequent studies and invocations of the term. In this short piece, I consider what is at stake in naming and developing the “Salween” River. Seemingly left off the map for a long time,<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-81-2" href="http://www.mekongcommons.org/politics-of-place-naming-salween-river/#fn-81-2">2</a></sup> the name and term Salween is now being more visibly contested, mapped, and stabilized. I argue that it is important to pay attention to the names we use (and discard), and who or what those names privilege. In the context of increased development and international attention, there is both risk for homogenizing the multifaceted histories of the river basin, and an opportunity for multiple invocations of the river to be considered and circulated.</p>
                    <p><a class="cboxElement" title="The politics of place naming reaches the Salween River" href="http://www.mekongcommons.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Salween_Vanessa.jpg" rel="lightbox[81]"><img class="wp-image-134 size-large" src="http://www.mekongcommons.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Salween_Vanessa-640x360.jpg" alt="People disembarking and leaving the Salween River." width="640" height="360" /></a></p>
                    <p>The Salween River, a transboundary river, emerges in the Tibetan uplands and flows through China, Thailand and Myanmar. As the longest free-flowing and as yet still un-dammed river in Southeast Asia, it is a significant source of food and livelihoods for millions of people across its basin. Presently, the Salween is being redefined in the context of large-scale infrastructure development. As the region’s countries pursue economic growth, the Salween is being invoked as a ‘natural resource’ and energy development planners are increasingly paying attention to the basin, with 20 large dams now proposed by investors from Thailand, China and Myanmar.</p>
                    <aside class="pullquote">
                        <p>&ldquo;Energy development planners are increasingly paying attention to the basin&rdquo;</p>
                    </aside>
                    <p>While the name Salween has been relied upon in many development agreements, in 2011 the government of Myanmar officially changed the river’s name to Thanlwin. This move is related to the way that the name “Salween” emerged: Salween is a British corruption of the Burmese word Thanlwin. In the 1800s, the name “Salween” was enshrined in colonial documents and maps of Southeast Asia, and was then circulated and propagated across Europe and North America. In many ways, the politics of place naming we see here invoke Emerson’s critique of the term “Southeast Asia”: it honors outside colonizers, not the peoples and places of the region. But that is not to say that all names or stories necessarily accomplish these same ends.</p>
                    <p>Thanlwin. Mother. Eater of people. Natural resource. Political boundary. Angry. Energy rich flow resource. Nujiang. Nam Kong. Salawin.</p>
                    <p>These are some of many names and phrases that refer to this same river that I have heard across the basin. These multiple names reflect the river’s cross-border position and the region’s multifaceted histories.</p>
                    <h2>What else do these multiple names and phrases tell us about the river?</h2>
                    <p>While development interests have primarily focused on the “Salween,” such development plans have simultaneously spurred interests in knowing more about the river, invoked by many names, and by a whole range of actors. This has attracted engineers, social scientists (like myself, a geographer), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and national governments to record the natures and histories of this now “at risk” ecosystem.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-81-3" href="http://www.mekongcommons.org/politics-of-place-naming-salween-river/#fn-81-3">3</a></sup>Across the river basin, residents, NGOs, and academics are also working to document local riverine ecologies, and their names, “from the bottom up”.</p>
                    <p>One such project was conducted in Karen State near an important bend in the river called Khoe Kay, where the river forms the political border between Myanmar and Thailand. This collaborative project by ethnic Karen residents, activists, and academics focuses on biodiversity. The team was the first group of researchers to be allowed by the local community to write down and systematize the knowledge and expertise of local residents. Their research was published by the Karen Environment and Social Action Network (KESAN); visit their site to read more about the research process in the 2008 report<a href="http://www.kesan.asia/index.php/resources" target="_blank">“Biodiversity in Peril”</a>.</p>
                    <p>One of the most compelling features of this collaborative research project was the way that species identification—a form of naming—was conducted. Local researchers helped conduct research based on a local set of parameters that focused on the researchers’ five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. For instance, whether or not a plant species was hard or soft, hairy or itchy, or what sounds tree leaves made in the blowing wind, were relied up on as identification markers. While this is not unlike more conventional scientific assessment that look to properties or particular markers in species identification, it does represent a certain shift in terms of who the experts, or “namers”, are. Even though academics specializing in plant species identification might be better positioned to provide or identify Latin names for local plants, local residents were both better identify species names in local languages and provide identification related to, for instance, the sounds that leaves make.</p>
                    <p>This link between identification, expertise and “who can name” are seen not only in research, but also in more popular presentations of the river basin. For instance, names and experts differ greatly across and within films about or featuring the Salween, including locally produced films and Hollywood depictions of the region.</p>
                    <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/le6jugBlh5U" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
                    <p>In these films not only is the name “Salween” used, but multiple names, narratives, and languages are portrayed. The three films included below are not meant as a complete inventory, but they do represent the collaborative efforts of local NGOs, and residents to differently imagine residents’ relationships to the river and the basin. These films invoke multiple histories, different namers, and I would argue, different kinds of interventions.</p>
                    <p>One film listed above focused on perceptions of the river-border via a local participatory project called Villager Research (in Thai: Thai Baan). Not all that different from the Khoe Kay study, Villager Research sees local residents collaborate with NGO staff and academics, who act as research assistants, to conduct research on issues of ecological significance. Villagers in this film invoke the river as, for instance the River “Kong” and the “river of life”, but also mentioned in the films are the everyday activities of residents and their significance: “The Salween is my home”… “gives us everything we need”… “The Salween is not only for us”… “peoples of the Salween basin have been protecting natural resources.”</p>
                    <aside class="pullquote">
                        <p>&ldquo;A name does not simply exist; it is constructed with meaning and with implications for who can &lsquo;know&rsquo; about it.&rdquo;</p>
                    </aside>
                    <p>In contrast, consider Hollywood’s portrayal of the Salween: Rambo. The most recent Rambo film actually takes place along the river where it forms the political border between Thailand and Burma, introducing us to Rambo’s “home” at the Salween where he has lived since his last exploit (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awy8gLd8B-I" target="_blank">trailer</a>). The images and narrative here conjure and emphasize histories of violence and oppression, with outsiders serving as both the main characters and the “last hope” for the region. As the narrator notes, “Burma’s a war zone”… “You know his name”… “A warrior will come.” Residents, their livelihoods, and the river are part of the backdrop for the action to unfold.</p>
                    <p>Rambo’s portrayal of the Salween is obviously very different from the depictions in the biodiversity report above; but it is also strikingly different when contrasted with local films about the same area. When you realize that Rambo is portrayed as living in the same area that the abovementioned films document, the distinctions are all the more striking. Local residents in those productions are not shown fleeing violence or set as part of the landscape, but are instead positioned as experts who are connected to an important place and who represent themselves as agents of river management.</p>
                    <p>This relationship between naming and expertise—as seen in different names and portrayals of this river across the basin—emphasizes that naming does matter. A name does not simply exist; it is constructed with meaning and with implications for who can “know” about it. There is still much to be accomplished in this regard. Many large projects are being planned in the basin without adequate studies or knowledge of local ecologies and their existing management regimes, and without the participation and knowledges of local residents. As a small contribution to understanding the relationships between peoples and ecologies of the region, attention to the names we use and the politics of place naming has the potential to honor multiple histories but also to better acknowledge contingency—that rivers, naming, and development can be done differently.</p>
